# mini hydroponics
This is the repo for a hydroponics control system I've put together.  It runs on an ESP8266 and it performs the following functions:
* water pump cycling
* light cycling
* temperature measurement
* TDS (total dissolved solid) measurement
* web server (to view live data and control lights/pump)
* mqtt interfacing to allow IFTTT interface with google assistance
* mDNS to allow easy local web access

here is a screenshot of the webserver:
